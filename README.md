# Four In a Row Game
This was a project for the Treehouse course [Object-oriented JavaScript By Example](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-challenge).
I built the game independently for the most part. A couple functions are the work of Treehouse, and all the HTML and CSS belong to Treehouse and are not my original work.
However, I did independently build out the classes, the majority of the methods and the game logic.
